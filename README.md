# simpleCmsApi
This is but a simple API and a sports themed CMS made on PHP, here you will find the backend DB, the web service (necessary for the app that uses the API) and the cms webpage. Although the backend was designed for an app and the web style in the CMS is not great.
If you want to try out the CMS to get it running you have to have SQL installed and create a DB dedicated to the CMS.
first thing you have to do is to open the file xml_info/bd
