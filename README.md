# simpleCmsApi
This is but a simple API and a sports themed CMS made on PHP, here you will find the backend DB, the web service (necessary for the app that uses the API) and the cms webpage. Although the backend was designed for an app and the web style in the CMS is not great.

0- If you want to try out the CMS to get it running you have to have SQL installed.
1- First thing you have to do is to edit the files includes/clase_bd.php and servicio_web/includes/clase_bd_servicio.php, insert there the necesary info to connect to the data base.
2 -Next thing you have to do is to open the includes/clase_bd.php and it will create the tables necesary for the CMS to work the first time it's open.
3-Now in your browser navigate to the folder in wich you have the index.php and it will ask you to do the first time configuration, from there on you can use the CMS as you please.

This CMS/API isn't a profesional work, is a rather simple project to test/show/improve my php capacities feel free to use it as you please, i will upload the mobile APP that relies on this API in another repository.
